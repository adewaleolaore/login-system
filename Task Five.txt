Instructions

From your knowledge of PHP forms and files, PHP loops, functions and sessions, create a basic authentication page that does the following:

-    register (a new user can register, their details stored in a database file). 

-    login (checks in the file and logs them in if they are already registered)

-    reset password

-    logout

 

NOTE: Storing details in a Database file means that the data you get from your user inputs should be stored in a file (i.e you are to use a file as your database, as opposed to using query languages)
